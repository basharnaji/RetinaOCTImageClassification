# Retina_OCT_Image_Classification

This proeject is a colloboration to tackle to tackle the problem of Retinal OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography).  Even though this problem has had many different soluitons we are approaching it with a "limited" dataset point of view.  We are take a small sample of the labelled images and then using GANs to generate new images that will be used to train the model.
